Distinguishing what
Big O Arrays are and their use

â€¢ We use Big O to describe the performance of an algorithm

Big O Notation
O(n)

Accessing array element
Resized to remove and add information 
Use data structure such as linked list
 
Big O comes into play for becoming really scalable

Methods displayed in Github are:
Big 0 = 0(n)
- Array
- Array looped
- Two arrays looped with two separate parameters

O(n^2)
- algorithm run in quadratic time 
- faster that linear than O(n) 
O(log n) 
- Compared to linear, grows at same rate but slows at some point
- More efficient and scalable then linear and quadratic

example
Array of sorted number
Find 10
Linear array to loop through 1 - 10
Binary search 
	- Runs logarithmic time
	- Searches target number and narrows down target easier

Exponential growth
	- Opposite of logarithmic growth
	- Not scalable at all

Overview 
	- Constant
	- Logarithmic
	- Linear
	- Quadratic
	- Exponential

Space complexity
-  developer code for users 
- Optimizing code for scalability

Arrays 

Integer in java take 4 bytes
In java arrays are static

Dynamic arrays
-Let us use information from arrays and add and delete information from an array 

Linked lists
- Can be updated unlike static arrays
Links connect to each other almost like components in a class or in react hooks place, it connects separate components together like a hook
